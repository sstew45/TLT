## Background

I have been learning, using and teaching about statistics for more than two decades, and I thoroughly enjoy my current role as a Biostatistician at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) in Little Rock, Arkansas. My areas of interest include:

-   advancing my software skills:
    -   R for data manipulation and analysis
    -   Quarto for communications and reproducible research
    -   Git for version control
-   analysis of text data
-   analysis of geospatial data
-   data visualization
-   statistics and data science education

My wife and I enjoy time with family (we have five children and a dog), outdoor activities, cooking, and cheering for our favorite sports teams.

## Data Drives Discovery Blog

With this blog, my primary hope is to better organize my ideas and workflow. If others benefit from the content, then I would regard this as a wildly successful endeavor.

Most of the content at this site will be focused on R, Quarto, and specific data-related problems that interest me. My latest obsessions are related to geospatial and text data analysis, so content related to these topics will initially be geared towards beginners like myself.
